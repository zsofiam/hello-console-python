# Hello, Console!

## Story

Let's open up your "Hello" program to communicate with the outer World!

## What are you going to learn?

- call programs from command line with arguments
- import a built-in module
- handle list contents

## Tasks

1. Modify `hello.py` to greet the name or names given after the script's name at the prompt. Running the script with no arguments still prints `"Hello, World!"`
    - Running `python3 hello.py Joe` writes `"Hello, Joe!"` to the console
    - Running `python3 hello.py Cotton Eye Joe` writes `"Hello, Cotton Eye Joe!"`
    - Running `python3 hello.py` writes `Hello, World!` to the console

## General requirements

None

## Hints

Python gives access to the command line arguments through the built-in `sys.argv` list (see the first linked background material). You should use indexing, slicing, and joining to access and effectively manipulate the contents of this list (see the other two linked materials).
